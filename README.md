## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this Udacity training project, I was interestested in using some public data from 2 sources:
INSEE which is French institue for statistics
DATA.gouv.fr which provide all type of public data in different format, such as excel or basic csv files

I wanted to analyse some datasets related to people who are playing with wind in the French metropolitan area. Playing with wind could be Paragliding, speedflying, or just flying a kite.
I covered the 3 mains question that are:
1. Who are the most represented in the overall population?
2. Are there any differences between men and women?
3. Where are those people located and why?

## Results<a name="results"></a>
You can find a jupyter notebook where all dataset are read and analysis is performed to produce some grpahical outputs.
